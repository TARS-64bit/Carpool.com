## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a decentralized application that can interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and managed using the Hardhat development environment. The frontend is built with React.js, allowing users to interact with the blockchain directly from their web browser.

## Features

- **Smart Contracts**: Built using Solidity and compiled/deployed with Hardhat.
- **React Frontend**: Allows users to interact with the smart contracts through a web interface.
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Uses web3.js or ethers.js to connect with Ethereum blockchain.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can interact with the app using their MetaMask wallet.
- **Unit Testing**: Tests written using Mocha/Chai.

## Tech Stack

- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework.
- **Ethers.js or Web3.js**: JavaScript libraries for interacting with Ethereum.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet.
- **Mocha/Chai**: Testing framework.
